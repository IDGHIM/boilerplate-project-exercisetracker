## ‚úÖ Project Tests (User Stories)

1. You should provide your own project, not the example URL.
2. You can `POST` to `/api/users` with form data username to create a new user.
3. You can make a `GET` request to `/api/users` to get a list of all users.
4. The `GET` request to `/api/users` returns an array.
5. You can make a `GET` request to `/api/users/:_id/logs` to retrieve a full exercise log of any user.
6. Each item in the log array that is returned from `GET /api/users/:_id/logs` is an object that should have a `description`, `duration`, and `date` properties.
7. You can add `from`, `to` and `limit` parameters to a `GET /api/users/:_id/logs` request to retrieve part of the `log` of any user. `from` and `to` are `dates` in `yyyy-mm-dd` format. `limit` is an integer of how many logs to send back.
